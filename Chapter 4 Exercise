Exercises Section 4.1.2
//Ex 4.1
//What is the value returnned by 5 + 10 * 20 / 2?

Answer : 105;

//Ex 4.2
//Using Table 4.12. parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped?

a. * vec.begin() // = *(vec.begin())

b. * vec.begin() + 1 // = (* (vec.begin())) + 1

Exercise Section 4.1.3
//Ex 4.3
//Order of evaluation of most of the binary operators is left underfined to give the compiler opportunites for optimization.
//This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potentil pitfalls in the use of language by the programer.
//Do you consider than an acceptable trade off? Why or Why not?

Answer : More convient for me.

Exercises Section 4.2
//Ex 4.4 Parenthesize the following expression to show how it is evaluated.
//Test your answer by compiling the expression (without parentheses) and printing its result.

12 / 3 * 4 + 5 * 15 + 24 % 4 / 2;

Answer: ( (12 / 3) * 4) + (5  * 15) + ( (24 % 2 ) / 2) 
Answer: ( ( 12 / 3 ) * 4) + (5 * 15 ) = 16 + 75 = 91

//Ex 4.5
//Determine the result of the following expressions.
(a) -30 * 3 + 21 / 5
A: -90 + 4.2 = -85.8;

(b) -30 + 3 * 21 / 5
A: -30 + 63/5 = -30 + 12.6 = -17.4

(c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5
A: 10 * 3 % 5 = 30 & 5 = 0

(d) -30 / 3 * 21 % 4
A: -10 * 21 % 4 = -210  % 4 = -2

//Ex 4.6
//Write an expression to determine whether an int value is even or odd.
/*
int i;
cin >> i;

if (i % 2 == 0){
  cout << "even" << endl;
}
else{
  cout << "odd" << endl;
}

return 0;
*/

//Ex 4.7
//What does overflow mean? Show three expression that will overflow
//The maximum value a type can hold, if it's over, it go reverse and become negative.

Int = 2^31
double = 2^63
bool = 2^7

Exercise Section 4.3
//Ex 4.8
//Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical OR, and equality operators
AND, &&, when both a and b is true

OR, ||, Either condition is true, then the statement is true.

Equality, when A and B are equal length and same letter. Then the statement is true.

//Ex 4.9
//Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:

const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)
/
//True, because cp is a non-null pointer.
//True, if the character cp points to is nonzero.

//Ex 4.10
//Write the condition for a while loop that would read intS from the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.

int i;
while (cin >> i){
  if (i == 42){
    break;
  } 
  cout << i;
}
cout << endl;
 
//Ex 4.11
//Write an expression that tests four values, a , b, c, and d, and ensures that a is greater than b,
which is greater than c, which is greater than d.

int a,b,c,d;
cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;

if (a > b && a >> c && a >> d) {
  cout << " a is greater";
}

//Ex 4.12
//Assuming i, j, k are all intS, explain what i != j < k means.

int i, j, k;
i != j < k, it seems like the condition j is not equal to i, and j is less than k.
//Bool result

i != (j < k)
